# Battleship Game!

This is a digital version of the classic and beloved board game Battleship! The original game is often 
enjoyed by two people sitting opposite each other as they attempt to destroy the other person's 
fleet. It's an intense and exciting game that normally cannot be played without a partner. With this 
digital version of the game players will be able to play at a moment's notice no matter where they are as long 
as they have a smart device to connect them to the internet. They will no longer have to wait for a partner to enjoy the 
game as they will be able to play online against the computer, and have the same excitement. This version of battleship 
follows the same rules as the original, the user will play again the computer, they will each have 5 ships place randomly 
on the grid and have 10 turns to destroy the other's fleet.

## Features

* ### The Grid 
* The grid is made up of a square that is ten cells in width and length, giving the players plenty of space to set up their fleet.
* The rows are are labled from 1 to 10 for clarity and ease of use.
* The columns are labeled A to J in order to give the ten by ten space, and are seperated by the pipe (|) symbol for readability.
  

## Gameplay  

* ### The Rules
* The user will not be able to see the five ships on the grid that will be randomly placed.
* They will be prompted to pick a row and a column.
* For the row the player must enter a number between 1 and 10, and a letter between A and J for the column.
* After the user takes a turn they will receive feedback to let them know if they hit or missed.
* The player wins once all five battleships are sunk.
* If the player has not sunk all the ships after ten tries they will lose. 


## Player Interaction 
  

* ### The Feedback  
* At each turn the player will be informed about the outcome of the choices made in the game.
* If a player places an invalid input, the game will let them know that it's not valid, and ask them to try again.
* They will also be informed if they've added an input that they've previously written, and be asked to place a new one.
* When the player misses a shot, they will receive a message to let them know, and the area where they missed will be marked with a minus symbol (-).
* When a player makes a successful hit, they will receive a message, and that area will be marked with an X.
* When a ship is sunk, they will receive the message "You sank all 5 battleships!".


## Testing

##Bugs
* The code has a lot of bugs including indentation errors incorrectly written methods. 

* ### Pep8
* Testing through pep8 returned sixteen error messages, and so the code did not pass this test.
  

## Credit

* ### Content
* The layout of the game is fairly simple, I looked at some online examples, the first one from this [Website](https://copyassignment.com/battleship-game-code-in-python/)
* From this site I was able to see the basic and simple layout of the grid.
* I originally planned to allow the user to choose the grid size, but I wasn't able to figure out the right methods to make it work.
* I used chatgpt to double check any syntax errors in my code, and to remove any unnecessary elements that were not useful in the code.
* The majority of my project was done by following various YouTube tutorials and using them to get my desired outcome.
* The main video I used came from the Knowledge Mavens YouTube [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alJH_c9t4zw&ab_channel=KnowledgeMavens), this video guided me through most of the methods and steps, but I changed the code to simplify it to what I understand.
* Unfortunately I could not get the game to function. The window after deployment only displays an error message.
* Further time is needed to understand the concepts of python and its logic.
